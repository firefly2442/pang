Following along Game From Scratch tutorial:

http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Game-From-Scratch-CPP-Edition.aspx

Pang, it's kinda like the old game (replace "a" with "o").

I've modified it from the original tutorial by adding SFGUI, porting
the example to version 2 of SFML, and some other things.  Folks have been
kind enough to post some examples of SFML 2.0 code here and there so
I've been learning from that.


Requirements:

-SFML (version 2)
http://www.sfml-dev.org/
-SFGUI (latest development version)
http://sfgui.sfml-dev.de/

Building:

-It uses CMake, just specify SFML and SFGUI and away you go
