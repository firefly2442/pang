Following along Game From Scratch tutorial:

http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Game-From-Scratch-CPP-Edition.aspx

Pang, it's kinda like the old game (replace "a" with "o").

I've modified it from the original tutorial by adding SFGUI, porting
the example to version 2.X of SFML, and some other things.  Folks have been
kind enough to post some examples of SFML 2 code here and there so
I've been learning from that.


##### Requirements:

* [SFML 2.X](http://www.sfml-dev.org/)
* [SFGUI](https://github.com/TankOs/SFGUI)
* [sfeMovie](https://github.com/Yalir/sfeMovie)
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)

##### Building:

* It uses CMake, just specify SFML, SFGUI, and sfeMovie and away you go
* A C++ 11 compiler is required.
